# Taxi-Fare-Prediction
Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model to predict taxi fare amounts based on trip data. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable prediction system using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques.
Project Steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: The raw data is loaded and cleaned to ensure quality, including                                     handling missing values and converting datetime columns.

Feature Engineering: Useful features such as trip distance, trip duration, pickup hour, and day of                       the week are extracted to improve model performance.

Model Training: Initial model training is conducted using a simple regression model (e.g., Linear                   Regression) and later optimized with advanced models like RandomForestRegressor.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search with cross-validation is performed to identify the best model                           parameters for optimal performance.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

Visualization: A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted fare amounts is created to visualize model                   accuracy.

Model Deployment: The trained model is saved for future deployment and API integration.

Libraries Used

Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

LinearRegression: For basic regression modeling.

RandomForestRegressor: For training a more advanced regression model.

GridSearchCV: For hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

Metrics (mean_squared_error, r2_score): For evaluating model performance.
